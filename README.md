## MimiEats: Healthy Eating for a Sustainable Future

A fullstack blog built on Django, HMTL/CSS (Bootstrap), and Firebase.
Project built and administrated in SCRUM, with Jira for planning and
organizing.

#### Goal

For individuals and families looking to adopt healthier eating habits, the **MimiEats Blog** is an educational platform that encourages sustainable and mindful eating through science-backed articles and various recipes from pop media and experts. Unlike traditional recipe and health blogs, our website fosters healthy habits advised in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4 (promoting mental health and well-being) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), offering content that emphasizes the connection between nutrition, mental health, and environmental sustainability.
